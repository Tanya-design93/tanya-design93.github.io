       <p> Hello!

       My name is Tanya, I was born in Ukraine, but I reside in Canada. After I graduated from university with a Master of Psychology, I took a career in Human Resources. When I moved to Canada , I decided to make a career change and to dive into a more creative and high-tech field of Web Development. My path into Web Development started with many hours of online learning and creating projects, of which you can check below. 
       
       I really hope I can turn this hobby into a career, because it is what I truly enjoy, and I look forward to improving my skills every day. I've learned that every website is very much like a unique story, and I enjoy to code as much as I like to make designs.
